# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

rust-bert-score is a Rust implementation of BERTScore, a metric for evaluating text generation quality using BERT embeddings. The library leverages the rust-bert crate for pre-trained transformer models and provides high-performance computation of similarity metrics between text pairs.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Build with optimizations
cargo build --release

# Build with LTO optimization
cargo build --release-lto

# Run tests (comprehensive suite)
cargo test

# Run tests single-threaded (for model download tests)
cargo test -- --test-threads=1

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Check code without building
cargo check

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy

# Build and test CLI
cargo install --path . --bin bert-score
bert-score score --help
```

## Architecture

The codebase follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns organized into the `core` module:

1. **Tokenization Layer** (`core/tokenizer.rs`): Wraps rust-bert tokenizers with HuggingFace integration. Handles text preprocessing, batching, and special token management. Supports multiple model families (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa).

2. **Model Layer** (`core/model.rs`): Manages pre-trained encoder loading and hidden state extraction. Uses enum-based dispatch to support different architectures while maintaining a unified interface.

3. **Computation Layer**:
   - `core/score.rs`: Token-level cosine similarity and greedy matching (formerly similarity.rs)
   - `core/idf.rs`: IDF weighting for token importance
   - `core/baseline.rs`: Score normalization and rescaling

4. **Pipeline Layer** (`core/pipeline.rs`): High-level BERTScorer API that orchestrates the full scoring pipeline.

5. **CLI Layer** (`cli/`): Professional command-line interface using clap with subcommands for scoring and similarity computation.

6. **API Layer** (`core/api.rs`): HuggingFace Hub integration for automatic model and vocabulary file downloading.

## Key Implementation Notes

- The library uses `tch` (PyTorch bindings) for tensor operations and supports both CPU and GPU computation
- Model weights are automatically downloaded via rust-bert's resource management system
- HuggingFace integration enables direct model downloads via `hf-hub` crate
- Error handling uses `anyhow::Result` throughout for consistent error propagation
- Iterator-based parallel processing with `rayon` for improved performance
- Professional CLI with `clap` provides batch processing capabilities
- Comprehensive test coverage with both unit and integration tests

## Current Status

âœ… **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**: All core functionality implemented and tested. The project includes:
- Full BERTScore pipeline with all features (IDF, baseline rescaling, multi-reference)
- Professional CLI tool with HuggingFace integration
- Comprehensive test suite (16+ tests covering all major components)
- Performance optimizations including LTO compilation and iterator-based parallelization
- Clean modular architecture with backward compatibility
- Documentation and examples

Development patterns to follow:
- Use `tch::Tensor` for all numeric computations
- Maintain device consistency (CPU/GPU) throughout operations
- Support batched operations for efficiency
- Follow the original BERTScore paper's algorithms
- Use iterator-based patterns for parallelization

### Key Decisions & Insights
**Tokenizer Implementation Analysis:**
- Uses `TokenizerOption` from rust-bert for flexibility across model types
- Properly handles padding, attention masks, and token type IDs
- Returns both padded tensors and raw token lists for downstream processing
- Supports truncation strategies and configurable max length
- Clean separation between tokenization and tensor creation

**Model Implementation Analysis:**
- Enum-based design (`EncoderModel`) supports BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa
- Automatically downloads pre-trained weights via rust-bert's resource system
- Configured to output all hidden states for layer selection
- Uses `no_grad` context for inference efficiency
- Returns Vec<Tensor> containing embeddings from all layers

**Similarity Module Implementation:**
- Core `compute_bertscore` function handles pairwise scoring
- L2 normalization for proper cosine similarity computation
- Efficient matrix multiplication for similarity calculation
- Greedy matching via row/column max operations
- Supports both weighted (IDF) and unweighted scoring
- Proper masking to exclude special tokens and padding
- Unit tests validate correctness of each component

**IDF Module Implementation:**
- `IdfDict` struct manages token-to-IDF score mappings
- Computes IDF using formula: log((N+1)/(df+1)) for smoothing
- Set semantics ensure tokens counted once per document
- Special tokens explicitly assigned zero weight
- Supports precomputed IDF dictionaries for efficiency
- Converts token IDs to weight tensors for GPU computation
- Handles unseen tokens with default score log(N+1)

**Baseline Module Implementation:**
- `BaselineScores` struct holds P/R/F1 baseline values
- Rescaling formula: (score - baseline) / (1 - baseline)
- `BaselineManager` handles multiple model/language combinations
- Supports loading baselines from TSV files
- Includes common defaults for popular models
- Handles edge cases (baseline = 1.0) gracefully
- Makes scores more interpretable (baselineâ†’0, perfectâ†’1)

**Pipeline Module Implementation:**
- `BERTScorer` is the main entry point for users
- `BERTScorerConfig` provides comprehensive configuration options
- Handles batching automatically for efficient processing
- Supports both single and multi-reference scoring
- Builder pattern for convenient configuration
- Orchestrates: tokenize â†’ model forward â†’ similarity â†’ optional IDF/baseline
- Layer selection supports positive/negative indexing
- Manages special token identification across model types

**Integration Observations:**
- Model and tokenizer use consistent device placement
- Both modules return compatible tensor formats
- Token type IDs handled correctly (Some for BERT/DeBERTa, None for others)
- Special tokens handled via masking in similarity computation
- IDF weights integrate seamlessly with similarity scoring
- Baseline rescaling is purely post-processing (doesn't affect computation)
- Pipeline successfully integrates all components into cohesive workflow

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Model Variant Support**: Solved using enum dispatch pattern
2. **Resource Management**: Leveraging rust-bert's automatic download system
3. **Special Token Handling**: Using BOS token as CLS equivalent, proper masking
4. **Tensor Type Issues**: Careful handling of boolean vs float tensors for masking
5. **Batch Processing**: Efficient slicing and per-pair processing within batches

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each module has focused tests for its core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Full pipeline validation including multi-reference support
- **Coverage**: 15 total tests covering all major code paths
- **Edge Cases**: Empty inputs, special tokens, baseline edge cases all tested

### Performance Considerations
- Batched processing for efficient GPU utilization
- Pre-normalized embeddings for fast cosine similarity
- Matrix multiplication for pairwise similarity computation
- Optional features (IDF, baseline) can be disabled for speed

### Next Steps
1. **Build & Deploy**: Run `./build.sh` to compile with Python bindings
2. **Performance Testing**: Run benchmarks with `cargo bench`
3. **Integration**: Test with real model files and vocab
4. **Publishing**: Prepare for crates.io and PyPI release
5. **Community**: Gather feedback and contributions
