## 1   Strategy 3 – Direct Final-Score Agreement on a Diverse Ad-hoc Set

### 1.1  Sentence-pair suite

*Goal = wide linguistic and length coverage while staying small (≤1 k pairs).*

1. Collect 150 English paraphrase / non-paraphrase pairs from:

   * PAWS-Wiki (positive & adversarial negatives).
2. Collect 150 MT outputs & references (e.g., WMT16 `newstest2016` en-de).
3. Add 50 synthetic edge cases:

   * Empty candidate, identical sentences, all punctuation, emoji-heavy, code snippets, long (≥512 tokens) etc.
4. Save as `data/direct_eval_pairs.tsv` with columns:

   ```
   id <TAB> candidate <TAB> reference
   ```

   ID convention `S###`.

### 1.2  Python reference run

```python
# scripts/run_direct_py.py
import pandas as pd, bert_score as bs
df = pd.read_csv("data/direct_eval_pairs.tsv", sep="\t")
P, R, F1 = bs.score(
    df["candidate"].tolist(),
    df["reference"].tolist(),
    model_type="roberta-large",
    lang="en",
    rescale_with_baseline=True,
    verbose=True,
    batch_size=32,
)
df["P_py"] = P.numpy(); df["R_py"] = R.numpy(); df["F1_py"] = F1.numpy()
df.to_csv("reports/direct_scores_python.csv", index=False)
```

### 1.3  Rust run (choose binding path)

*Assume* the crate `rust_score` exposes a PyO3 binding:

```python
# scripts/run_direct_rust.py
import pandas as pd, rust_score
df = pd.read_csv("data/direct_eval_pairs.tsv", sep="\t")
scorer = rust_score.BERTScorer(
    model_type="roberta-large",
    lang="en",
    num_layers=24,          # roberta-large last layer
    rescale_with_baseline=True,
    batch_size=32
)
P, R, F1 = scorer.score(df["candidate"].tolist(), df["reference"].tolist())
df["P_rust"] = P; df["R_rust"] = R; df["F1_rust"] = F1
df.to_csv("reports/direct_scores_rust.csv", index=False)
```

If PyO3 bindings are not ready, compile a CLI:

```bash
cargo run -p rust_score_cli -- \
  --input data/direct_eval_pairs.tsv \
  --output reports/direct_scores_rust.csv \
  --model roberta-large --lang en --baseline
```

### 1.4  Comparison & tolerance selection

```python
# scripts/compare_direct.py
import pandas as pd, numpy as np, scipy.stats as ss
py = pd.read_csv("reports/direct_scores_python.csv")
rs = pd.read_csv("reports/direct_scores_rust.csv")
assert (py.id == rs.id).all()

delta = (py[["P_py","R_py","F1_py"]].values - rs[["P_rust","R_rust","F1_rust"]].values)
abs_max = np.abs(delta).max()
print("max absolute diff:", abs_max)

corr = ss.pearsonr(py["F1_py"], rs["F1_rust"])[0]
print("Pearson corr:", corr)

# auto-decide tolerance:
tol = 1e-6 if abs_max < 1e-6 else 1e-4
print("Chosen tolerance:", tol)
```

*Pass criteria*

* `abs_max ≤ tol` **and** Pearson ≥ 0.99999.
  *Report* tables of deltas; plot `F1_py` vs `F1_rust`.

Write Jupyter or Markdown report `reports/direct_agreement.md` summarising statistics.

## 2   Strategy 1 – Replicate WMT16 Metrics-Task Correlation

### 2.1  Data acquisition

1. **System outputs**:

   ```
   https://www.statmt.org/wmt16/metric-task.html
   ```

   – download `metrics-task.tgz`, extract `DA-syslevel` & `DA-seglevel`.

2. **Human DA scores**: file `DA-sys.txt` and `DA-seg-scores.txt`.

3. Focus on `en–de` **news** (most cited in paper). Keep others optional.

4. Create `data/wmt16/` structure:

   ```
   src.txt   # source sentences (optional)
   ref.txt   # human reference
   sys/      # one file per MT system
   human_sys_scores.tsv
   human_seg_scores.tsv
   ```

5. Preprocess: strip BOMs, ensure UTF-8, replace tabs with single space.

### 2.2  Python run

```python
# scripts/run_wmt16_py.py
from pathlib import Path, PurePath
import pandas as pd, bert_score as bs, tqdm

REF = Path("data/wmt16/ref.txt").read_text().splitlines()
systems = sorted(Path("data/wmt16/sys").iterdir())
records = []
for sys_path in tqdm.tqdm(systems):
    cand = sys_path.read_text().splitlines()
    P,R,F1 = bs.score(
        cand, REF,
        model_type="roberta-large",
        lang="en",
        batch_size=64,
        rescale_with_baseline=True,
        idf=True
    )
    records.append({
        "system": sys_path.stem,
        "mean_F1_py": float(F1.mean())
    })
pd.DataFrame(records).to_csv("reports/wmt16_sys_scores_py.csv", index=False)
```

Compute **seg-level scores** similarly, but store one row per segment with columns `system,id,F1_py`.

### 2.3  Rust run

Mirror the same loops with the Rust scorer. Example using PyO3 binding:

```python
# scripts/run_wmt16_rust.py
import rust_score, pandas as pd, tqdm, pathlib
REF = pathlib.Path("data/wmt16/ref.txt").read_text().splitlines()
scorer = rust_score.BERTScorer(model_type="roberta-large", lang="en",
                               batch_size=64, idf=True, rescale_with_baseline=True)
records = []
for sys_path in tqdm.tqdm(sorted(pathlib.Path("data/wmt16/sys").iterdir())):
    cand = sys_path.read_text().splitlines()
    _, _, F1 = scorer.score(cand, REF)
    records.append({"system": sys_path.stem, "mean_F1_rust": float(sum(F1)/len(F1))})
pd.DataFrame(records).to_csv("reports/wmt16_sys_scores_rust.csv", index=False)
```

Segment-level: produce `reports/wmt16_seg_scores_rust.tsv` with `system`, `seg_id`, `F1_rust`.

### 2.4  Correlation analysis

```python
# scripts/compare_wmt16.py
import pandas as pd, scipy.stats as ss

human_sys = pd.read_csv("data/wmt16/human_sys_scores.tsv", sep="\t")
rust = pd.read_csv("reports/wmt16_sys_scores_rust.csv")
py   = pd.read_csv("reports/wmt16_sys_scores_py.csv")

merged_rust = human_sys.merge(rust, on="system")
merged_py   = human_sys.merge(py,   on="system")

print("System-level Pearson (Python):", ss.pearsonr(merged_py["human"], merged_py["mean_F1_py"]))
print("System-level Pearson (Rust):",   ss.pearsonr(merged_rust["human"], merged_rust["mean_F1_rust"]))

# seg-level
human_seg = pd.read_csv("data/wmt16/human_seg_scores.tsv", sep="\t")
seg_py  = pd.read_csv("reports/wmt16_seg_scores_py.tsv", sep="\t")
seg_rs  = pd.read_csv("reports/wmt16_seg_scores_rust.tsv", sep="\t")

def corr(df_metric, label):
    merged = human_seg.merge(df_metric, on=["system","seg_id"])
    rho = ss.stats.spearmanr(merged["human"], merged[label]).correlation
    print(label, "Spearman:", rho)

corr(seg_py, "F1_py"); corr(seg_rs, "F1_rust")
```

*Pass criteria*

* Rust correlations within **±0.002** of Python correlations.
* System ranking identical (Kendall τ = 1 between Rust and Python system means).

Generate PDF/PNG bar charts of human vs metric for both versions.

## 3  Strategy 4 – Tokenization & Embedding Parity Check

### 3.1  Test sentences

Create `tests/sentences.txt` (≤10 diverse sentences). Example lines:

1. `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .`
2. `Transformers are changing NLP .`
3. `¿Dónde está la biblioteca ?`
4. `你好 ， 世界 ！`

### 3.2  Dump tokens & IDs

**Python**:

```python
# scripts/dump_tokens_py.py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-large")
for line in open("tests/sentences.txt"):
    ids = tok(line.strip(), add_special_tokens=True)["input_ids"]
    print(line.strip(), ids, sep="\t")
```

Save to `reports/tokens_py.tsv`.

**Rust**:

Implement a binary `rust_score_cli dump-tokens` returning tab-separated sentence → list of IDs. Equivalent example:

```bash
cargo run -p rust_score_cli -- dump-tokens \
   --model roberta-large --input tests/sentences.txt \
   --output reports/tokens_rust.tsv
```

Compare files line-by-line (`diff`) or programmatically to assert equality.

### 3.3  Dump embeddings

Expose a debug flag in Rust scorer:

```
scorer.dump_embeddings(inputs, layer=24)  -> Vec<Vec<[float;768]>>
```

Python side:

```python
import torch, transformers, json, numpy as np
mdl = transformers.AutoModel.from_pretrained("roberta-large", output_hidden_states=True).eval()
tok = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-large")
for line in open("tests/sentences.txt"):
    ids = tok(line.strip(), return_tensors="pt").input_ids
    with torch.no_grad():
        hs = mdl(ids).hidden_states[24][0]      # layer 24, sentence dim 0
    np.savetxt(f"reports/emb_py_{hash(line)}.txt", hs.numpy())
```

Rust: call similar dump, write to `reports/emb_rs_<hash>.txt`.

Compare with Python using numpy:

```python
for h in hashes:
    a = np.loadtxt(f"reports/emb_py_{h}.txt")
    b = np.loadtxt(f"reports/emb_rs_{h}.txt")
    diff = np.abs(a - b).max()
    print(h, diff)
```

*Pass criterion*: `max_abs_diff ≤ 1e-6` for every vector element.

---

## 4   Test-Driven & Automation Notes

1. **CI flow (GitHub Actions)**:

   * job `python_check` → installs python deps, runs scripts 1.2, 2.2, 3.2; commits artifacts.
   * job `rust_check` → builds crate, runs scripts 1.3, 2.3, 3.3.
   * job `comparisons` (depends on both) runs 1.4, 2.4; fails action if tolerances unmet.

2. **Unit tests** (`tests/`)

   * `test_token_match.rs` uses Rust library only: encode a sentence, compare tokens to hard-coded HF tokens.
   * `test_similarity.rs` verifies that internal similarity matrix for a trivial pair equals manual dot product.
   * `test_idf.rs` verifies correct IDF values for a toy corpus.

3. **Artifact retention**: keep `reports/*.csv`, `reports/*.png`, and environment logs as build artifacts for reproducibility.

---

## 5   Deliverables

1. **Scripts & CLI** under `scripts/` (see code stubs).
2. **Rust library** with PyO3 bindings and a CLI sub-command suite:

   * `score`, `dump-tokens`, `dump-embeddings`.
3. **README\_compile.md** explaining build flags (`--features cuda`).
4. **Final technical report** (`reports/comparison_report.md`) containing:

   * environment details,
   * direct-score agreement stats + scatter plot,
   * WMT16 correlation tables (Python vs Rust),
   * token/embedding parity tables,
   * conclusion.

---

### Immediate Next Steps for the Agent

```plaintext
1. Generate Dockerfile(s) and `requirements.txt` + `Cargo.toml` updates.
2. Scaffold Rust crate `rust_score` with functions:
   - tokenizer_from_pretrained
   - bertscore_score
   - dump_tokens
   - dump_embeddings
3. Write PyO3 bindings exposing `BERTScorer` class.
4. Implement CLI with sub-commands: score, dump-tokens, dump-embeddings.
5. Implement Python helper scripts in `scripts/`.
6. Write unit tests in `tests/`.
7. Add GitHub Actions YAML for CI.
8. Execute Strategy 3 scripts; adjust tolerance dynamically as in 1.4.
9. Execute Strategy 4 token/embedding checks.
10. Download WMT16 data, preprocess, and run Strategy 1.
11. Generate plots and compile `comparison_report.md`.
```

This plan gives precise, code-level instructions for both Python and Rust pipelines, end-to-end data handling, and rigorous statistical comparisons, satisfying scientific reproducibility standards while clearly demonstrating that the Rust BERTScore implementation matches the reference Python implementation.


------


Understood. I will analyze the original BERTScore paper and GitHub repo to identify the benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols used. I’ll then determine all viable strategies for comparing our new Rust implementation to the original Python implementation.

This will include methods such as output agreement on standard benchmarks, correlation with human scores, direct cosine similarity comparison, and token alignment matching. I’ll also rank these methods by their evidential strength (how convincing they are) and feasibility (ease of implementation and data access).

I’ll report back with a ranked list of comparison methods, their pros/cons, and recommendations for demonstrating equivalence between the two pipelines.


# Comparing Rust and Python BERTScore Implementations

To ensure a new Rust implementation of **BERTScore** is equivalent to the original Python package, one should validate it through multiple comparison strategies. These range from reproducing published benchmark results (formal tests) to direct side-by-side output checks (informal tests). Below, we detail various strategies at different layers of the BERTScore pipeline, explaining each method, the component it tests, its evidential strength, and its feasibility.

## 1. Reproduce WMT16 Machine Translation Benchmark (Formal Test)

* **Method:** Run both the Rust and Python BERTScore on a standard MT evaluation dataset (e.g., WMT16 metrics task data). Collect segment-level scores for each candidate–reference pair and compute correlation with human judgments (e.g., Pearson or Kendall correlation as in WMT16/WMT18 evaluations). Compare the Rust implementation’s correlations to those reported by the original Python version. They should match the published results if the implementation is equivalent.
* **Component tested:** This tests the *entire end-to-end metric* on a large scale. It validates tokenization, embedding, similarity computation, and aggregation by seeing if the final BERTScore outputs lead to the same system- and segment-level rankings as the original.
* **Evidential Strength:** High. Successfully replicating the WMT16 benchmark results (e.g., reproducing BERTScore’s strong Pearson correlation with human scores) is very convincing evidence. It demonstrates that the Rust version can serve as a drop-in replacement in a real-world evaluation and produces identical conclusions about system quality as the Python package.
* **Feasibility:** Moderate. WMT16 data and human scores must be obtained (often available from WMT or the BERTScore repo). Running the evaluation requires scoring many translation outputs, which can be time-consuming but is straightforward with automation. Interpreting the outcome is easy: if the correlations and relative rankings of systems match the original, the implementations are equivalent. (Minor numeric deviations should not alter which metric has highest correlation, etc.) This is a formal but feasible test since the BERTScore GitHub even provides tools for WMT16 correlation checks.

## 2. Reproduce MS-COCO Image Captioning Evaluation (Formal Test)

* **Method:** Compare the implementations on an image captioning benchmark, such as the COCO 2015 Captioning Challenge. Use the human evaluation data for caption quality (e.g. the percentage of captions evaluated as equal/better than human – “M1”, and indistinguishable from human – “M2”). Compute system-level BERTScore for each of the challenge submissions using both Rust and Python code, with *multiple reference handling* (BERTScore computes candidate vs each reference and takes the best score). Then calculate Pearson correlation of BERTScore with the human metrics M1/M2, and compare to the original results. The Rust implementation should replicate the Python package’s correlations (the paper showed BERTScore surpassing other metrics like SPICE).
* **Component tested:** This also tests the full pipeline end-to-end, **including multi-reference support**. It verifies that token matching and score aggregation across multiple references work identically to the original. It focuses on a different domain (image captions) to ensure robustness in another setting.
* **Evidential Strength:** High. Matching the original metric’s performance on COCO (a known challenging evaluation where BERTScore had high correlation with human judgments) strongly indicates equivalence. It shows the Rust version handles multi-reference and content-word importance (IDF) weighting correctly (since the original found IDF weighting beneficial for captioning). Success here means the new implementation isn’t only mathematically equivalent, but also yields the same advantages as Python BERTScore in practice.
* **Feasibility:** Moderate. The COCO 2015 data (captions and human judgments for \~5k images across 12 systems) needs to be obtained. The BERTScore GitHub hints at how to replicate these experiments. Running the evaluation is computationally heavier (many candidate-reference comparisons with up to 5 references each), but still doable. Results are straightforward to interpret: the Rust version should produce almost identical Pearson correlations to the Python version for M1 and M2 metrics, and rank the captioning systems in the same order. Any significant discrepancy would signal an implementation issue.

## 3. Direct Score Comparison on Custom Test Cases (Informal Check)

* **Method:** Prepare a diverse set of sentence pairs (candidate and reference) – for example, a mix of short, long, paraphrased, and dissimilar sentences. Run both implementations on these pairs to obtain the BERTScore precision, recall, and F1. Then compare the outputs directly, checking if they are identical or within a tiny tolerance. One can automate this by computing differences for each pair or plotting one implementation’s scores against the other. Ideally, all points should lie on the line *y = x* (perfect agreement). For an aggregate view, measure the Pearson correlation between the Rust and Python score lists (this should be \~1.000) or the maximum absolute difference (should be near 0).
* **Component tested:** This is an **end-to-end pipeline test on a sample of inputs**, covering tokenization, embedding, similarity, and final aggregation in one go. Unlike formal benchmarks, it doesn’t require human scores – it simply verifies that for any given input, the two implementations *directly produce the same metric output*.
* **Evidential Strength:** High (depending on sample size). If dozens or hundreds of varied examples all show virtually identical P/R/F1 scores from Rust and Python, that’s strong evidence the implementations are equivalent in all the key components. This check is convincing because it’s a direct one-to-one comparison of outputs – any divergence would immediately reveal a discrepancy in the pipeline. While not tied to external ground truth, a broad test set can cover many scenarios (e.g. synonym differences, word order changes, completely unrelated sentences) to instill confidence.
* **Feasibility:** **Easy and quick.** This is one of the most convenient checks – you just feed the same inputs to both packages and collect outputs. Both implementations should be using the same pre-trained model (e.g., RoBERTa-large or BERT-base) and settings. Interpreting results is straightforward: ideally the scores match exactly to several decimal places. Minor floating-point differences might occur but should be negligible (e.g., differences <1e-6). If any substantial differences appear on any test pair, you have immediate feedback to investigate which stage caused it. Overall, this strategy provides a fast sanity check before deeper analysis.

## 4. Tokenization Consistency and Embedding Parity (Pipeline Internal Check)

* **Method:** Dive one level deeper by verifying the intermediate outputs of both implementations. First, check that the **tokenizer** in Rust produces the exact same token sequence (subword tokens and their indices) as the Python/HuggingFace tokenizer for a given input sentence. Next, extract the actual BERT embeddings for those tokens from both implementations. This may involve modifying the code or using a debug mode to output the vectors. Compare the embeddings for each token position – ideally they should be numerically identical (or differ only by tiny floating-point rounding). For example, you might pick a simple sentence and log the last-layer embedding of each token from both Rust and Python for direct comparison.
* **Component tested:** This tests the **text preprocessing and model encoding layer** of BERTScore. It verifies that the Rust version is using the same vocabulary and tokenization rules, and that it loads the BERT/RoBERTa model weights correctly to produce the same contextual embeddings as the reference Python implementation. Essentially, it isolates the neural network component of BERTScore.
* **Evidential Strength:** Very High. If tokenization and embeddings line up exactly, it means the core computations (the heavy lifting of BERT’s forward pass) are correct. Any difference here would likely propagate to final scores, so matching at this level is a powerful confirmation of equivalence. It gives confidence that both implementations are literally on the same representational footing before computing similarities. However, this check alone doesn’t prove the scoring logic is correct – it only certifies the inputs to the scoring step are identical.
* **Feasibility:** Moderate. Checking tokenization is easy (both implementations can output tokens for a given string). Comparing embedding vectors requires access to internal model outputs. In Python (with HuggingFace Transformers) one can get hidden states; in Rust, one must expose the model output. It might involve writing a small test script. The comparison itself (e.g., L2 difference or cosine similarity between corresponding vectors) is simple once the data is obtained. Interpreting the result is clear-cut: if embeddings differ beyond minor numerical precision, something is wrong in model initialization or token handling. This method is a bit technical and usually only needed if there’s suspicion of a low-level discrepancy, but it is very effective for pinpointing issues early in the pipeline.

## 5. Cosine Similarity Matrix Comparison (Pipeline Internal Check)

* **Method:** Have both implementations compute the full token-to-token cosine similarity matrix for a given candidate-reference pair, and then compare these matrices element-wise. For instance, take a pair of sentences and obtain the matrix where entry (i, j) is the cosine similarity between the *i*th token in the candidate and *j*th token in the reference. One can retrieve this from the Python implementation (the BERTScore code computes it internally) or by manually computing `cos_sim = (E_c * E_r^T)` after extracting embedding matrices. Do the same in the Rust implementation (perhaps by exposing a function to get the similarity matrix). Then inspect the two matrices: every corresponding cell should be nearly identical. You can quantify differences by taking the maximum absolute difference across all cells or looking at the distribution of differences.
* **Component tested:** This targets the **similarity computation layer** of BERTScore. It assumes the embeddings are correct and now checks that the Rust code computes cosine similarity the same way as Python – including vector normalization and dot-product computations. Essentially it validates the math for token similarity and ensures no divergence due to, say, precision, normalization mistakes, or use of a different formula.
* **Evidential Strength:** High. If the similarity matrix from Rust matches Python’s, it is compelling evidence that both the embeddings and the similarity calculations are consistent. Even a small error in normalization or a misaligned token would produce noticeable differences in some cells. By catching agreement at this granular level, you virtually guarantee that any subsequent aggregation (max-pooling and averaging) will also agree. It’s a rigorous check – effectively a unit test for the core scoring matrix.
* **Feasibility:** Moderate. Unlike final scores, most APIs don’t directly expose the full matrix, so you might need to compute it manually. With embeddings from each side, it’s easy to calculate externally. Alternatively, one could instrument the code to print the matrix (for a reasonably short sentence pair to keep it readable). The comparison can be automated (e.g., ensure all differences < 1e-6). Interpreting results is straightforward: near-zero differences mean success. This method is slightly effort-intensive but invaluable if you suspect a subtle discrepancy in how similarities are computed or want absolute assurance of internal correctness.

## 6. Token Alignment and Score Breakdown Verification (Pipeline Internal Check)

* **Method:** Drill down into how the final Precision/Recall scores are composed by examining token-level alignment scores. For a given candidate-reference pair, have both implementations identify each token’s *best-match similarity*. For example, obtain the list of similarity values for each candidate token (each value is the maximum similarity against any reference token) and likewise for each reference token (max similarity against candidate tokens). Compare these lists between Rust and Python. They should match element-wise. Additionally, check that aggregating these (averaging them) yields the same Precision and Recall. You can also compare which specific token in the reference was matched for each candidate token (to ensure the argmax is picking the same match, though if the max values coincide, the actual index should as well). Essentially, this is verifying the greedy matching procedure described in the BERTScore paper is implemented identically.
* **Component tested:** This focuses on the **alignment and pooling logic** – how BERTScore turns the similarity matrix into Precision, Recall, and F1. It ensures that the Rust code is correctly doing the “for each token in candidate take max similarity (Precision), for each token in reference take max (Recall)” and then computing F1. Any differences here could come from, say, an off-by-one indexing bug or not handling duplicates the same way, so this catches issues in the metric aggregation layer.
* **Evidential Strength:** High. Matching token-level scores and alignments provides very convincing evidence that the *logic* of the metric is the same. It goes beyond just matching final F1 by confirming the intermediate contributions are identical. This is particularly important if the final scores were found to differ in some edge case – this analysis pinpoints whether a specific token’s contribution was handled differently. If all tokens align perfectly, it solidifies that both implementations are doing the exact same matching (greedy max-matching) procedure. In combination with a matching similarity matrix, this virtually guarantees identical final P/R/F1.
* **Feasibility:** Moderate to Difficult. Neither implementation may readily output per-token scores by default, so some custom handling is needed. In Python, one could reuse the similarity matrix and simply compute the row-wise and column-wise maxima. In Rust, if direct introspection is hard, you might mimic the calculation externally using the Rust-produced similarity matrix or scores. Another approach is to run both implementations in a step-by-step mode (if available) or even compare the summed Precision/Recall components (the sum of max similarities) before dividing by length. Interpreting the comparison is clear: any mismatch in these lists or aggregates is a red flag. While a bit laborious, this method provides fine-grained verification – often used once an issue is suspected, or to double-confirm everything after other checks pass.

## 7. Robustness and Behavioral Checks (Adversarial Examples Test)

* **Method:** Test both implementations on challenging examples where BERTScore’s behavior is known from the literature. A prime candidate is the PAWS adversarial paraphrase dataset. This dataset has pairs of sentences that are tricky paraphrase cases (word swaps, etc.) which fool weaker metrics. Run Rust and Python BERTScore on a sample of PAWS pairs. Compare their outputs in terms of how they distinguish paraphrases from non-paraphrases. For example, measure the average BERTScore for true paraphrase pairs vs. for non-paraphrase (adversarial) pairs, for each implementation. They should both show a similar gap – i.e. higher scores for genuine paraphrases and lower for adversarial pairs, reflecting the original finding that BERTScore is more robust to such examples than n-gram metrics. You could also compare classification decisions if you set a threshold: do both implementations flag the same pairs as “high similarity” vs “low similarity”?
* **Component tested:** This is a **holistic behavior test** of the metric under stress conditions. It doesn’t isolate a single part of the pipeline, but checks that the *overall outcome* from input to score is consistent between implementations on edge cases. If there were any subtle differences in handling of punctuation, stopwords, or weighting, they might be exposed by adversarial examples that push the metric to its limits.
* **Evidential Strength:** Medium. If both implementations react the same way on known tough examples (assigning similarly high scores to paraphrases and low to tricky non-paraphrases), it boosts confidence that the Rust version truly mirrors the Python version’s strengths. It’s not as precise as a numeric equality check – rather, it’s about equivalence in *behavioral trend*. A convincing result is if the Rust and Python scores not only correlate nearly perfectly on this dataset, but also yield the same qualitative conclusions (e.g., “BERTScore stays high for paraphrases but drops for word-scrambled imposters” – and both implementations agree on the extent). This kind of test provides evidence to end-users that the new implementation hasn’t introduced any regression in what the metric captures.
* **Feasibility:** Moderate. PAWS or similar data is publicly available, and running the metric on a few hundred sentence pairs is not too burdensome. No special instrumentation is needed – just use both tools to get scores. The results might be compiled into a small table or plot (for instance, score distributions for paraphrase vs non-paraphrase). Interpretation requires some care: you’re looking for alignment between Rust and Python outputs, and checking that known robust behavior is preserved. It’s a bit more interpretative than a direct numeric check, but quite feasible. This method is supplementary – usually performed after basic equivalence is established, as an additional assurance of quality (especially important if the metric is used for tasks focusing on nuance or adversarial cases).

## Ranking of Strategies by Utility and Recommendations

Considering **evidential strength** (how convincing the test is) and **feasibility** (ease of execution and clarity of results), we can rank the above strategies in terms of overall utility:

1. **Direct Final Score Comparison on a Diverse Sample (Strategy 3)** – *Top ranked.* This method is **highly feasible** and offers strong evidence of equivalence. Simply feeding identical inputs to both implementations and verifying matching outputs is quick and definitive. A large and varied test set can give very convincing assurance. Because it directly checks what users care about (the final P/R/F1 scores) on many examples, it has an excellent combination of evidential strength and ease. We recommend this as a first-line validation: if the Rust implementation produces virtually identical BERTScores as the Python package across a broad sample, it’s a clear indicator of correctness.

2. **Replicating a Published Benchmark (WMT16 MT Correlation – Strategy 1)** – This is a close second in utility. Its evidential strength is **very high** because it demonstrates that the Rust version can reproduce the original metric’s real-world evaluation outcomes. It’s slightly more effort than a quick sample test, but still quite feasible with available data and scripts. Reproducing WMT16 (or a similar benchmark) reassures stakeholders that nothing has changed in the metric’s effectiveness or behavior. We recommend formally replicating at least one such benchmark. If one must choose, WMT16 to-English is a good option (it was used to tune the metric and provides a known standard for correlation). Success here means the Rust implementation is essentially interchangeable with the Python one for MT evaluation tasks.

3. **Tokenization & Embedding Parity Check (Strategy 4)** – Ranked third, this is a very **powerful diagnostic test** with somewhat lower practicality for end-users. Its strength lies in pinpointing any low-level implementation differences. In terms of utility, it’s most useful for developers during debugging or initial validation. If there’s any doubt about the Rust model integration, this check will clear it up. We recommend performing this internally at least once (on a couple of example sentences) to catch any misalignment at the source. Once confirmed, one can be confident the foundation (text encoding) is solid, which makes all higher-level comparisons more reliable. The feasibility is moderate (requires code access), but the payoff in certainty is high.

4. **COCO Captioning Correlation Replication (Strategy 2)** – This comes next: it has high evidential value (testing multi-reference handling and another domain) but is a bit more niche and labor-intensive than WMT16. Its overall utility is strong if your use-case involves image captioning or multi-reference evaluations. We suggest it as a **secondary formal test** if resources allow, especially to demonstrate that the Rust implementation handles multiple references and IDF weighting exactly like the original. If time or data is limited, one might skip a full COCO replication, but doing it adds extra confidence (and checks an additional part of the code responsible for combining multiple references).

5. **Cosine Similarity Matrix & Alignment Checks (Strategies 5 & 6)** – These are extremely **convincing** if you need absolute proof at every step, but they rank slightly lower in overall utility for routine validation. They tend to be more involved to set up and aren’t usually necessary unless discrepancies arise. Their evidential strength is on par with Strategy 4 (since they validate internal computations), but the feasibility is lower. We recommend using these if the simpler end-to-end comparisons (strategies 1–3) show any inconsistencies. For example, if final scores differ in a corner case, a similarity matrix comparison and token alignment audit will pinpoint the divergence. In absence of problems, you might not need to run these for every model – they are essentially **unit tests** for the metric’s internals. They’re invaluable for troubleshooting and ensuring no subtle bugs, but not as generally convenient as the higher-ranked methods.

6. **Adversarial/Robustness Behavior Test (Strategy 7)** – This is ranked slightly lower in utility because it’s more a qualitative confirmation than a strict equality check. Its feasibility is moderate and the evidence it provides, while useful, is not as clear-cut as exact score matching. However, it serves as a good **extra mile** demonstration. If your goal is to convince others that the Rust implementation preserves all properties of the original, showing it performs similarly on a challenging dataset like PAWS can help. We consider this an optional but nice-to-have comparison, especially if the metric will be used in settings where robustness matters. It’s a way to ensure that beyond just matching numbers, the Rust port didn’t inadvertently alter how the metric handles tricky linguistics.

**Recommended Shortlist:** In practice, the most effective approach is to combine a **broad end-to-end output comparison** with at least one **formal benchmark replication**. Therefore, we highly recommend: (a) performing a large-scale direct score comparison (Strategy 3) to establish point-by-point equivalence, and (b) reproducing a key benchmark result like WMT16 correlation (Strategy 1) to demonstrate alignment with published evidence. These two in tandem cover both low-level exact agreement and high-level real-world validation. Additionally, as an internal sanity check, do a one-time verification of tokenization/embedding consistency (Strategy 4) to rule out any hidden implementation mismatch. Together, these methods will provide compelling proof that the Rust BERTScore implementation is producing results indistinguishable from the original Python package, across all levels of the computation.
